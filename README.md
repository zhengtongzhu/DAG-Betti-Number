# DAG Betti Number Computation
Maximal betti number computation for DAG (directed acyclic graph). The main function and the comparisons with the general algorithm are provided.<br />
For the comparison, I generate random graphs with a specified structure, the edges are randomly selected from a base graph (fully connected) without replacement. The density represents the proportion of edges selected from the base graph.<br />
200 realizations are done and total time spent are recorded for each density.<br />
Graph1: 2 layers with 10 nodes each layer.<br />
Graph2: 3 layers with 10 nodes each layer.<br />
Graph3: 4 layers with 4 nodes in the first layer and 10 in other layers.
