# DAG Betti Number Computation
Maximal betti number computation for DAG (directed acyclic graph). The main function and the comparisons with the general algorithm are provided.
For the comparison, I generate random graphs with a specified structure, the edges are randomly selected from a base graph (fully connected) without replacement.\\
Graph1: 2 layers with 10 nodes each layer.\\
Graph2: 3 layers with 10 nodes each layer.\\
Graph3: 4 layers with 4 nodes in the first layer and 10 in other layers.
