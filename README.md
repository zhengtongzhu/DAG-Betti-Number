# DAG Betti Number Computation
Maximal betti number computation for DAG (directed acyclic graph). The main function and the comparisons with the general algorithm are provided.
For the comparison, I generate random graphs with a specified structure, the edges are randomly selected from a base graph (fully-connected) without replacement.
